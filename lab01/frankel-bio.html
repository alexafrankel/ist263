        Hi, my name is Alexa Frankel. I am a junior who is studying Digital Retail Strategies 
        in the iSchool with a minor in Public Communications. I am super interested in design 
        and technology, so Digital Retail Strategies made sense for me. My skills include graphic 
        design, leadership, and knowing how to use technology. An accomplishment I have is my business 
        Lexs Dope Designs. Outside of school and work I like to watch The Bachelor and Romance Movies. 
        I enjoy spending lots of time with my cat Teddy Bear as well. Some habits and interests of mine 
        is that I love to workout and journal when I have free time. I am super excited to use my experience 
        in technology and bring my skills to IST 263.
