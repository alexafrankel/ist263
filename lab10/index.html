        Hi, my name is Alexa Frankel. I am a junior who is studying <strong>Digital Retail Strategies</strong> 
        in the iSchool with a minor in Public Communications. I am super interested in design and technology, 
        so Digital Retail Strategies made sense for me. My skills include graphic  design, leadership, and 
        knowing how to use technology. An accomplishment I have is my business  Lexs Dope Designs. Outside of 
        school and work I like to watch The Bachelor and Romance Movies. I enjoy spending lots of time with my <br>
        cat Teddy Bear as well.Some habits and interests of mine is that I love to workout and journal when <br>
        I have free time. I am super excited to use my experience in technology and bring my skills to IST 263.

     </p>
