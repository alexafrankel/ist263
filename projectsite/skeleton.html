    <h2>Hi, I’m Alexa (not like the Amazon), </h2>
    <p>Welcome to my company Lex’s Dope Designs. It is my firm belief that a good challenge offers an opportunity to develop and improve, which is how Lex’s Dope Designs got created. I am a Philly based aspiring graphic designer, who loves fashion and design. Take a look at my gallery, blog, and trucker hats that I have done. Feel free to contact me afrankel@syr.edu
        XOXO, 
        Lex
