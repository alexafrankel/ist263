        You may have seen the term “y2k” trending on Tik Tok, and it's true… the early 2000s are back. You can spot Tik Tik populated with low rise jeans, mini handbags, big sunglasses, and you guessed it trucker hats. The first trucker hats came out in the early 1960s, and were used as cheap hats to give out in rural communities (Corporate Casuals). So how have they transformed from the “dad hats” to a pop culture phenomenon (Corporate Casuals)? Trucker hats are most known from their emergence in The Simple Life with Paris Hilton rocking them with the iconic juicy couture sweats (Huber 2021 Refinery29) .Celebrities were soon seen all over rocking the hat (Huber 2021 Refinery29). Recently though, celebrities like Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashion have been seen bringing out the iconic staple back. <br> 


        A 2022 spin though, is that you can expect to see a twist on these hats. Popular designers such  as Palm angels are taking a different approach with more modern designs and selling their hats for up to $300 dollars. Another popular 2022 brand, known as Aviator Nation, has also recently come out with their own collection of the iconic hat. You can see the hats include popular colors right now such as neon pinks, oranges, yellows, and more.
